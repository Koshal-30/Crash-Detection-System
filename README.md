# Crash-Detection-System
The dataset used for this project can be found here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NUwC-bkka0-iPqhEhIgsXWtj0DA2MR-F
Preprocessed the 1500 Crash Videos and 3000 Normal Videos into 4-Dimensional Tensors that can be plugged into Deep Learning Models
The first architecture we are going to use is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory.
